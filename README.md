Right now, our team is still trying to polish our prototype and add our completed navigation feature. The app works very simply, you can turn off/on location tracking with the corresponding button, 
switch location tracking on/off and change from where your location is being pulled from.
It also allows a user to save waypoints, view them in a list, and have them show up on an interactive map. We need to make the list human readable in the futute, though. 

Our goals so far are: 
Primary Goals
Our main goal is to develop an android app that functions as a GPS navigation system, allowing users to navigate from their point A to B. 
It should have user-friendly UI outfitted with textviews, buttons, switches, listviews, multiple pages, etc.
It should also display, manipulate current and relevant information such as: latitude, longitude, speed, location updates, etc. by grabbing location information 
Real-time traffic updates
Add/save waypoints

Stretch Goals:
Downloadable maps?
Traffic events/advanced driver data
Possibly making it compatible with a windows desktop environment. 
We essentially want our stretch goals to be additional features that enhance and/or grow the base app. This whole system should be completed within a timeframe of about 8 weeks, give or take. 

Our Next steps are: We need to turn out prototyped ideas into a more comprehensive, complete app that adheres to our goals. We will use our UI mockups and the experience we gained from practicing with the prototypes to implement the actual app. 
We should be able to finalize everything by the due date at the end of this week.
